At [Phosphorus][phosphorus], I mainly spent my time on developing software. I can't share any of the code I developed there, 
I can share one thing that I did make -- the logo.

Here's where it began.

<div style="text-align: center;">
{% include captioned-image.html url="phosphorus-square.png" description="Square Logo Attempt" style="height: 150px;" wrapperstyle="display: inline-block;" %}
{% include captioned-image.html url="phosphorus-original.png" description="Rounded Logo" style="height: 150px;" wrapperstyle="display: inline-block;" %}
</div>

It's undergone a few evolutions since its original form, but in essence, I was trying to convey Phosphorus' place on the 
periodic table (hence its atomic number 15), and the fact that we were doing genetic tests.

Since then, the design evolved. The colors became brighter. The lines connected to only one side.

<div style="text-align: center;">
{% include captioned-image.html url="phosphorus-new.png" description="New Logo" style="height: 150px;" %}
</div>

The logo has also been used in a variety of other contexts, from marketing materials to Rubiks cubes to cupcakes.
