The Postpartum Project is the largest online resource directory of postpartum specialists, with over 10k unique users
per month. I got involved because I believe the current model of finding and paying for therapy doesn't work.

Anyone who has looked for a psychotherapist can tell you it’s not easy. 

1. **Stigmas** — It’s often said that the hardest step is the first one; the realization that it’s normal to seek 
therapy. 
2. **Finding the right therapist** — There are hundreds of treatable conditions. Multiply that with dozens of common 
modalities, and it’s a headache to even know where to start looking for a therapist. Even if you find some promising 
therapists, [getting past their voicemail box][atlantic] might mean calling multiple different therapists. Meanwhile,
many therapists still struggle to fill their caseloads. 
3. **Paying for therapy** — Because of low insurance reimbursements and logistical difficulties, 30-50% of therapists  
only accept patients paying out of pocket. Their motivation is clear — the going rate for out-of-network therapy is between 
$150 and $300 per hour. In-network, reimbursements are well under $100 per session, they're capped annually for each patient, 
and they involve copious paperwork. That means that it's far harder for poorer people to get good treatment.

While I can't solve all of therapy, I wanted to break down some of those barriers and help expand access to care.
And so did Zoe Hicks, a therapist herself who founded the the [Postpartum Project][ppp] to help new mothers 
find the care they need. Now as co-founders, Zoe and I
are expanding the Postpartum Project to help inform parents, mitigate stigmas, and 
help people find the best postpartum care.
