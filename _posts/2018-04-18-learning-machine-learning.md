Machine learning. Turns out, it's much more like statistics than software engineering. Either way, it's fascinating, 
and I'm looking forward to applying it to more projects! Here's the progress I've made so far.

### Progress

1. [Andrew Ng's first Coursera course][coursera]. I started learning machine learning with this course. It's a great 
primer, based on the real CS229 course at Stanford and I'd recommend it to anyone starting off from a math/CS background.
2. [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow][book]. After I finished the Coursera course, I wanted
to start applying ML hands on. This book is the most modern one I could find, and so far it's been great.
3. [Andrew Ng's deep learning specialization][deep-learning]. I'm starting to work through the deep learning 
specialization. It's 5 courses but each one seems to be manageably short.

I'll keep adding materials onto here as I work on them. I'm also playing around with a couple Kaggle challenges, and 
I'll post more when I've found something interesting.
