<h4> Bio </h4>
</div>

<p> 
Hi! My name is Louis Rassaby and I'm a comp sci and quant econ major at Tufts University.
I'm originally from Australia, but I've lived in Montana for most of the past decade and
I'm spending my time off school either in Australia or in Prague, where my family now lives.
</p>

I'm passionate about music -- I play the cello, and I probably spend more time doing that
than just about anything else, though comp40 might be catching up! Another interest of mine
is spending time in the outdoors. Montana has given me a great appreciation of nature,
and when I'm not pursuing my academic and musical interests, you'll usually find me on
the slopes of <a href=http://bridgerbowl.com/>Bridger Bowl</a>.
